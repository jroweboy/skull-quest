Hi, I have a bank switching problem, hope somebody can help me.
I use cc65 with neslib (and nesdoug), and the MMC3 mapper.

Here's how I import each file for each bank.
    #pragma rodata-name("BANK2")
    #pragma code-name("BANK2")
    #include "bank2.h"

Then I put some nametables (with RLE compression) in bank2.h
    #include "I-CHR/cemetery.pngE/cemetery.h"

Then I call this when I load a level
    ...
    const unsigned char* current_nametable;
    ...
    bank_push(level_bank); 
    vram_adr(NAMETABLE_A);
    vram_unrle(current_nametable);
    bank_pop();

It works for some levels, but not for all. Sometimes it just freezes! The ppu is off when I load levels.

Is it a pointer problem? A size problem (some levels are more than 600 bytes)? 

Found some interesting details here: https://github.com/cppchriscpp/nes-starter-kit/blob/master/guide/section_3/putting_your_code_in_the_right_place.md but it doesn't work as expected. Here's my problem:
