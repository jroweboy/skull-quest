    
      The city of Xyleria
     was ruled by Kharzoid
   a dark and powerful wizard

   In his twisted imagination
he conceived a diabolical game
   filled with traps and foes

   Each year, a prisoner would
   get a chance of redemption 
  if he could succeed the trial 

     His soul was transferred
      into a magical skull
      If it got destroyed
       his soul was lost

   A brave and courageous man   
   stood up to the challenge

       He got put in jail       
    although he was faultless
      
       He waited patiently
    for the day of the Trial

       The day of revenge
